Development: [Mark Haferkamp](http://refola.com)

Inspiration:
* All the Lispers who've shown the expressive power that's possible in programming
* Egil MÃ¶ller for providing prior art in the form of [SRFI#49](http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html), which clearly shows that the most annoying of Lisp's parentheses can be removed
* Everyone behind the [Arc programming language](http://www.arclanguage.org) for inspiring thought of language minimalism
* The [Go](https://golang.org) contributors for making a non-Lisp language that's small enought to feasibly write a translator for
* Everyone who's contributed to other "turn language X into a Lisp" and "integrate a Lisp with language X" projects (Clojure, Lisp Flavored Erlang, etc) for showing that this isn't completely insane
 * In particular, the authors of [GLisp](https://github.com/zhemao/glisp) and [zygomys](https://github.com/glycerine/zygomys), which appear to be very close to what I'm trying to do, only from Lisp directions instead of a Go direction
* Friends and family who've encouraged my crazy ideas (I don't know who wants to be mentioned or not, so I'm leaving names out for now)
