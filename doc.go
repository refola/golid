/*
Piklisp will start using the following grammar:
* Everything between a pair of double quotes is treated as part of the same string.
** Inside a string, a backslash preceding another character escapes its normal meaning. Minimally this is just '\\' and '\"'.
* Parentheses group stuff.
* Whitespace separates things in a group.
